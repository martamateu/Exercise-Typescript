 ## Basic requirements üîß
 
It is proposed to make some classes to store the logic of an agenda with the data
individuals: addresses, telephones, emails... Each class must
be created in a different TypeScript file.

Person:
Name
Surnames
Age
ID
Birthday
Favorite color
Sex
Addresses
emails
phones
Grades

Direction:
Street
Number
Flat
Lyrics
Postal Code
Population
Province

Mail:
Guy
Direction

Telephone:
Guy
Number

The correct selection of types and the definition of necessary functions will be valued
for attribute access.

Once the classes are done:
* A main module (main) will be created in which the defined classes are used
to create 3 person records and display them in the terminal using console.
log., using the necessary functions defined in the classes to obtain
the data.

* One of the added person records will be modified, performing the search
by DNI and adding a new address, a new email and a new
telephone. These changes must be made by using methods defined
previously in class.
 
* The 3 records with the changes made will be shown from the main module
earlier in the console.
